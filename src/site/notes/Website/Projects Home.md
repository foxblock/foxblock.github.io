Developed for visualizing and analyzing the performance of a city-wide LoRaWAN network. The main goal was to handle 1M+ datapoints in real-time. Loads 1M datapoints (a 200MB csv file) in less than a second and displays them on top of a fully-featured OpenStreetMap renderer. Analytic tools like aggregations, displaying connections to gateway stations and more. All in real-time 60+ fps. Minimal dependencies (only curl and raylib).<br>Currently available upon request. |
