# Hi!
I am Janek, an engineer from Cologne, Germany.

This site contains some of my past and current projects, as well as my ["digital garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). It serves dual-purpose as a tool for myself to do some retrospective on projects and collect and reflect on topics I am learning.

I hope it is useful to you as well, be it as a source of knowledge or inspiration
