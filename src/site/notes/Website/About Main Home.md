# Hi!
I am Janek, programmer / engineer / tinkerer from Cologne, Germany.

My passion is building software for humans that lasts, combining electronics and design into interactive pieces and creating games for various platforms. Examples for all of these are showcased on the [[Website/Projects Home\|Projects page]].

Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, naturally my first "programming" experience was building a website for myself (using plain HTML, CSS and PHP). It showcased photos I took, cool videos I found on the web and "funny" jokes only me and my friends laughed about (and of course it had a forum with 2 active users, including me). It was online for a couple of years until the free webhosting provider I used went out of business. Nowadays the web is different, but mostly full of ads. Reading about the idea of a ["digital garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/) reminded me of the old days where the web was mostly about sharing your ideas and experiences. A place of curiosity without the immediate drive to make money off everything.

To participate in this idea, I publish some of my notes in my [[Website/Garden Home\|Digital Garden]]. If you find anything worthwhile or a mistake, consider leaving a comment.
