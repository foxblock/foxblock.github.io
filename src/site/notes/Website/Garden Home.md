This is my collection of notes and ideas. I write these for myself, so they might be gibberish for anybody else. I decided to publish them anyway as an experiment and I hope you find something worthwhile. If not that's okay, too.

Some starting points that might be of higher quality:
- [[Code/Langauges/Go\|Go]] - my cheatsheet for learning the programming language go
- [[Code/Rules for Code Comments\|Rules for Code Comments]] - flowchart and my approach to comments in code
- [[Technik/LoRaWAN\|LoRaWAN]] - learnings from my professional experience with LoRaWAN

Generally many notes are collections of knowledge I find on the internet (like what a LLM would spit out, only in this case it was curated by a human, which might be good or bad, depending on your stance). Some notes include my own opinion or experience from working on that topic.

In general I will try to add the following tags:
##knowledge-base for collections of technical information
##opinion for when texts contain my personal opinion
##experience for when I am talking from professional experience
##german some notes I take in English (usually when the subject matter is also English), some are in German, some are mixed (oh no...). I apply this tag to notes which are at least partially German.
## Some backstory
I used to have a pencil-on-paper notebook, which I tried to take everywhere. In 2024 I discovered Obsidian and quickly moved my whole process over to it. I was looking at Evernote for a while, but did not like the idea of putting all my notes in someone's cloud. 1,5 years later my vault grew to 200+ notes and I have it synced between all my devices. I still miss sketching with the pencil, but digital notes are just superior in several ways.

This garden will include some, but not all of my notes. I do not like publishing very rough stuff. Writing is not my strong suit, but this is an effort in getting better at it. Notes will probably start off as a list of bullet points and might grow into a more refined text later.

My Obsidian setup:
- Most core plugins disabled (except for crucial ones)
- Community plugins: cMenu, Excalidraw, File Diff, Lazy Plugin Loader (more like a hacky workaround, but it does help somewhat)
- Syncing between devices using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
- Publishing using the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) and my [github-pages template](https://github.com/foxblock/digitalgarden_gh-pages)
