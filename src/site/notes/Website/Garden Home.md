I used to have a standard pencil-on-paper notebook, which I tried to take everywhere. In 2024 I discovered Obisdian, after looking at Evernote but not really liking the idea of putting all my notes in someone's cloud. 1,5 years later my vault grew to 200+ notes and I have it synced between all my devices. I still miss sketching with the pencil, but digital notes are just superior in several ways.

This garden will include some, but not all of my notes. I do not like publishing very rough stuff. Writing is not my strong suit, but this is an effort in getting better at it. Notes will probably start off as a list of bullet points and might grow into a more refined text later.

In general I will try to add the following tags:
##knowledge-base for collections of technical information
##opinion for when texts contain my personal opinion
##experience for when I am talking from professional experience
##german for texts (partly) in German (leave a comment if I should translate these)

My Obsidian setup:
- Most core plugins disabled (except for crucial ones)
- Community plugins: cMenu, Excalidraw, File Diff, Lazy Plugin Loader (more like a hacky workaround, but it does help somewhat)
- Syncing between devices using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
- Publishing using the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) and my [github-pages template](https://github.com/foxblock/digitalgarden_gh-pages)
